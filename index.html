    <h2>Infosec with Sir Humphr3y</h2>
    <br><p>Hi! This is a tiny little project I've put together as part of the curriculum offered by the fine people over at <a href="https://hoppersroppers.org">Hopper's Roppers</a>. I don't really have a clue what I'm doing, but learning is fun.
        <br><p>Feel free to get in touch with me on <a href="https:twitter.com/josephdpower">Twitter</a> if you ever want to chat.</p>
